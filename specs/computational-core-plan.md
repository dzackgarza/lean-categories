# Computational core: execution plan

Requirements: [computational-core.md](computational-core.md) (identifiers `CC-*`).
Mathematical denotations: [FOUNDATIONS.md](../FOUNDATIONS.md), Parts I–IX.
Upstream issues: [#53](https://github.com/dzackgarza/lean-categories/issues/53),
[#54](https://github.com/dzackgarza/lean-categories/issues/54).

This plan is tracked in the repository deliberately: `.agents/plans/` resolves only in a
local checkout, and this work must be readable wherever the repository is.

## Rules for executing this plan

- **Step 0 is mathematics.** Every node begins by stating, in FOUNDATIONS with a citation or
  by naming the Mathlib declaration, the exact mathematical object it implements (CC-TRUE).
  A node whose object cannot be stated precisely stops there and records why.
- **Search before authoring, for every obligation** (CC-REUSE): definitions and proof obligations alike are first attempted by broad formalization-corpus API searches under several formulations; only glue and residue are hand-written, and the search record ships with the work. Known first candidates: Mathlib's `Functor`,
  `Functor.Elements`, `Arrow`, `Core`, `Over`/`Under`, `MonoOver`/`Subobject`,
  `Grothendieck`, `ModuleCat.restrictScalars`/`extendScalars`, `ConcreteCategory`, limits and
  kernels come first. Project code adds only the registry, the resolver and the realization
  boundary that no library supplies.
- **A construction claims its laws** (CC-LAWS). No node adds a runtime law check as an
  admission condition.
- **Each node names its consumer**: the smallest end-to-end call that must work when it
  closes, stated below as its acceptance.
- **Leaf spikes probe the core.** The formed-module/lattice chain, the ring diamond, the
  \(\mathbb F_4\) presentations and the hostile orthogonal-subgroup backend are probes; a
  defect a probe exposes is repaired in the core node that owns it.

## DAG

`Needs` lists immediate prerequisites.

| ID | Work and acceptance | Requirements | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cc-p0-denotation-audit` | **Audit delivered 2026-09-28: [registry-denotation-audit.md](registry-denotation-audit.md). §4 records the owner's rulings (forms cocartesian over total modules; lattices as refinements of Bil; integrality/evenness as value containment; frames abandoned for resolutions). Closed 2026-09-28; its code consequences are `cc-fib` and `cc-resolutions`.** Audit every registry entry kind (`NamedCategoryEntry`, `CategoryFamilyEntry`, `ClassifierEntry`, `FunctorEntry`, `StructuralPortEntry`, `OpaqueCategoryEntry`) and every `CategoryExpr`/`FunctorExpr`/`NatTransExpr` constructor for its mathematical denotation. For `CategoryFamilyEntry`/`familyApp`: state the fibration (or pseudofunctor with variance) each registered family denotes, citing FOUNDATIONS §13.2 / §83–86 for modules and bimodules; list every family that cannot name one. **Acceptance:** a table in FOUNDATIONS (or a linked appendix) with one row per kind and per registered family, each with its denotation and source; no row reads "parameterized by". Findings that require code changes become children of `cc-fib`. | CC-TRUE, CC-FIB | none |
| `cc-fib` | **Forms tower delivered 2026-09-28 in Lean: `Bil →p ∫Mod →q CommRing` with `p.IsCofibered` (FOUNDATIONS 31.2b/31.2c, [audit §6](registry-denotation-audit.md)); Module fibration registered 2026-09-28: `familyTotal`/`familyFibreInclusion`/`familyReindex`, `cat.modules_total`, `fun.modules.{fibre_inclusion,reindex,underlying}` with U on the total category; ℤ→ℤ/4 cardinality by `rfl`. Fibration rows 2026-09-28: `FibrationEntry` with checked `IsFibered`/`IsCofibered` evidence; `fib.modules`, `fib.modules_ext`, `fib.bilin_forms` registered. Fibre equivalences 2026-09-28: `Fiber p (R, W) ≌ BilinModuleCat R W` (`BilinFormsOverRings.fibreEquivalence`). Lattices as a refinement of `Bil` 2026-09-28: `clf.bilin_forms.lattice`, `cat.lattices_over_rings` (first registered refinement). Open: the remaining lattice conditions (finite projective/free, I-integrality, I-modularity, evenness via Δ) as classifiers, and retiring the discrete forms and lattice families.** Represent varying categories as fibrations. Register \(p:\int_R R\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}\to\mathbf{Ring}\) as a cartesian fibration with Mathlib's `ModuleCat.restrictScalars` as reindexing (and the cocartesian structure from `extendScalars` where used, with variance stated at each use). Fibre inclusions \(\iota_R\) and reindexing \(\varphi^{*}\) become `FunctorExpr` values derived from the fibration entry. The underlying-set functor is registered once on the total category. **Acceptance:** the CC-FIB acceptance — fibre over \(R\) evaluates to `ModuleCat R`; restriction along \(\mathbb Z\to\mathbb Z/4\) resolves as reindexing; cardinality agrees across the two fibres because both factor through the one total-category \(U\). | CC-FIB, CC-TRUE | `cc-p0-denotation-audit` |
| `cc-resolutions` | State, with sources, the theory of resolutions that replaces frames: augmented resolutions, their truncations (a classical presentation is the 2-truncation), and the general framework (projective/free, simplicial, cofibrant, comonadic). Then framed bundles as bundles with resolutions satisfying the stated conditions. Retire FOUNDATIONS §13.5–13.6 and the six frame families. **Acceptance:** a FOUNDATIONS section with citations for each notion; no code until it exists. | CC-TRUE | `cc-p0-denotation-audit` |
| `cc-quad-basechange` | Characteristic-free base change of quadratic maps (COMPLAINTS: "Quadratic base change requires `2` invertible"): search and read `DividedPowers4` (and further corpus formulations) for `Γ₂` and its base change; state the construction in FOUNDATIONS §15.6 with its source (Roby's universal property of `Γ₂`); only then build `Quad`'s pseudofunctor exactly as for `Bil`. **Acceptance:** `QuadWFormCat` base change and its coherence hold with no `Invertible 2` hypothesis, and evenness over `ℤ` is the `I = 2R` integrality of `Δ(L, b)`. | CC-FIB, CC-REUSE | `cc-fib` (forms part) |
| `cc-constructors` | Add #54's generic `CategoryExpr.constructor` case with typed constructor entries for `Elements`, `Arr`, `Core`, `Disc`, `Over`/`Under`, `MonoOver`/`Subobject` and functor categories, each evaluating to its Mathlib construction. **Acceptance:** CC-CALC's acceptance, plus #54's `Subobjects(Sets)` and slice/arrow/elements acceptance items. | CC-CALC, CC-TRUE | `cc-p0-denotation-audit` |
| `cc-actions` | A functor entry carries executable object and morphism actions on realizations together with its denotation (spec §8). Retire the one-constructor-per-map pattern. **Acceptance:** CC-ACTION's acceptance on the formed-module → module → set chain, realized over the fibration of `cc-fib`. | CC-ACTION, CC-SEP | `cc-fib`, `cc-constructors` |
| `cc-resolve` | Composite structural resolution per #53 §8 over one uniform functor graph (inclusions, classifier forgetful functors, fibration projections and reindexing are all `FunctorExpr`). Provenance retained; no shortest-path, order or priority rule; ambiguity is an error. **Acceptance:** CC-TRANSPORT, CC-UNIFORM and CC-RESOLVE acceptances; `L.cardinality()` for a formed module resolves to the three-step composite and reports its path. | CC-TRANSPORT, CC-UNIFORM, CC-RESOLVE | `cc-actions` |
| `cc-cohere` | Route identification by registered `NatTransExpr` comparisons. **Acceptance:** CC-COHERE's acceptance and the ring diamond (additive vs multiplicative distinct at monoids, identified at sets by a registered comparison). | CC-COHERE | `cc-resolve` |
| `cc-immediate` | Admission rules for leaf declarations: reject a functor that duplicates an existing composite with no new content; reject a method below its lowest generating level. **Acceptance:** CC-IMMEDIATE's acceptance with negative tests. | CC-IMMEDIATE | `cc-resolve` |
| `cc-props` | Classifiers as the only owners of property meaning; decision procedures register against a classifier with a three-valued result type. **Acceptance:** CC-PROP and CC-DECIDE acceptances; `is_abelian` is commutativity of the multiplicative port; pointwise-equal morphisms never decide `false`. | CC-PROP, CC-DECIDE | `cc-resolve` |
| `cc-universal` | Generic constructions with complete universal data: subobjects, kernels as \((K,i)\), quotients as \((Q,q)\) with factorization, limits as apex/legs/mediator — all from Mathlib owners. **Acceptance:** CC-UNIV's acceptance with a subgroup realized by a deliberately ill-structured backend handle. | CC-UNIV | `cc-constructors`, `cc-resolve` |
| `cc-lift` | Operations returning to the source side require registered lifts, sections, preserved limits or adjunctions. **Acceptance:** CC-LIFT's acceptance: the kernel of a formed-module morphism is a formed submodule via the registered restriction of forms; without it, a missing-lift diagnostic. | CC-LIFT | `cc-universal`, `cc-cohere` |
| `cc-realize` | Realization, evidence and implementation registries keyed by semantic `FunctorExpr`/classifier (#53 §10 `BackendRealizationEntry`), with trust levels and a memo table keyed by explicit application. **Acceptance:** CC-SEP, CC-ROUTE, CC-TRUST and CC-MEMO acceptances; two presentations of \(\mathbb F_4\) stay distinct (CC-CARRIER). | CC-SEP, CC-ROUTE, CC-TRUST, CC-MEMO, CC-CARRIER | `cc-actions`, `cc-props` |
| `cc-adapter` | The per-leaf Lean contract command (`register_realization …`) and result decoding into expected semantic types. Negative tests for every forbidden contribution in spec §5. **Acceptance:** CC-ADAPTER and CC-DECODE acceptances. Backend halves (Sage/GAP codecs) are implemented in `lean-cas-dsl` against this interface. | CC-ADAPTER, CC-DECODE | `cc-realize`, `cc-immediate`, `cc-universal` |
| `cc-closure` | Generated method closure: `#methods`, documentation and completion from one closure. **Acceptance:** CC-CLOSURE's acceptance: a new leaf with one structural functor into the module fibration inherits `cardinality`, `rank`, `kernel` with no further declaration. | CC-CLOSURE | `cc-resolve`, `cc-cohere`, `cc-lift` |
| `cc-dsl-migration` | `lean-cas-dsl` elaborates `x.f` to `f(F(x))` over this registry and deletes its own `CatDecl`/`FunctorDecl`/`ObjMap`/`profileFrom` graph (spec §6). **Acceptance:** its existing `Transport.lean` tests pass through the new resolver; the #53 §11 and §12 acceptance paths run end to end with both a Lean-native and a Sage realization. | all | `cc-adapter`, `cc-closure` |
| `cc-probe-corpus` | Port the `sage-categories` leaf probes as acceptance specimens: formed modules and lattices over the module fibration, the ring diamond, \(\mathbb F_2\) on \(\{0,1\}\) and \(\mathbb F_4\) under two presentations, the orthogonal-subgroup hostile backend, and the equality case of CC-DECIDE. **Acceptance:** each specimen runs through public DSL syntax only; any failure reopens the owning node above. | all | `cc-dsl-migration` |

## Order

`cc-p0-denotation-audit` first: it decides what the existing family machinery *means*
before anything is built on it. `cc-fib` and `cc-constructors` are independent after it.
Everything after `cc-resolve` can proceed in parallel where the `Needs` column allows.

## What is explicitly not in this plan

- Reproducing `sage-categories`' kernel: C3, dynamic classes, initializer threading,
  construction retention, state grafting (spec §3).
- A second semantic registry in `lean-cas-dsl` (spec §7, #53 §7).
- Certificates for trusted backends in the first slice (#53 §10); CC-TRUST records their
  status instead.
