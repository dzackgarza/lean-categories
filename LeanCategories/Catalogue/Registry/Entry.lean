# Registry entries

Declaration names are stored as Lean `Name` values.  JSON serialization is a
presentation concern; registration and environment lookup retain the checked
identity.

/-- A fibration registry row (CC-FIB): a registered functor `projection : total ⥤ base`
together with `evidence`, a Lean proof that it is a cartesian (`Functor.IsFibered`) or
cocartesian (`Functor.IsCofibered`) fibration. Its fibres are the categories that vary with an
object of `base`. -/

/-- One step of a structural route: a registered structural functor row, or the forgetful
functor `total(c) → host(c)` of a registered classifier. -/
inductive EdgeRef
  | functor (id : FunctorId)
  | classifierForget (id : ClassifierId)
  /-- A functorial constructor applied to a structural edge: `Arr(U)`, `Core(U)`. Derived, never
  registered. -/

  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- How a method's semantic functor consumes its receiver. -/

  /-- The functor's source is the owner category itself. -/
  | object
  /-- The functor's source is `Core(owner)`: an isomorphism invariant of objects of the owner. -/

  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- A method presentation row (#53 §7): the surface name `name` of the registered functor
`functor`, owned at the category `owner` (its lowest generating level, #53 §5). It creates no
semantics: it names checked functor semantics. -/
structure MethodEntry where
  id : MethodId
  name : String
  owner : CategoryExpr

  /-- The result is a subobject of the receiver's image, and must be lifted back along every
  step of the route to become a subobject of the receiver itself (CC-LIFT). -/

/-- What a lift row returns to the source of a functor `U : C ⥤ D` (CC-LIFT). -/
inductive LiftKind
  /-- Subobjects: `evidence` is a `MonoLift U`, and the row's step is `U.mapArrow`. -/
  | subobjects
  /-- Limits of the registered shape `shape`: `evidence` is Mathlib's `CreatesLimitsOfShape J U`
  for the functor `U` of the row's step, where `J` is the shape of the registered limits named
  `shape`. A limit computed in `D` is returned to `C` along it. -/
  | createsLimits (shape : String)
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- A lift row (CC-LIFT): `evidence` returns results computed along the route step `edge` to its
source, as `kind` says: subobjects (a `MonoLift`), or limits (Mathlib's `CreatesLimitsOfShape`). -/
structure LiftEntry where
  id : LiftId
  edge : EdgeRef
  evidence : Lean.Name
  kind : LiftKind := .subobjects
  deriving Repr

/-- A limit presentation row (CC-UNIV): `declaration` is a family of Mathlib `LimitCone`s (apex,
legs, `IsLimit` with its mediator) of the diagrams of one shape in the registered category
`category`, e.g. `Types.pullbackLimitCone` for pullbacks of sets. -/
structure LimitEntry where
  id : LimitId
  category : CategoryId
  shape : String
  declaration : Lean.Name
  /-- A colimit presentation: `declaration` is a family of Mathlib `ColimitCocone`s. -/
  colimit : Bool := false
  deriving Repr

/-- An adjunction row (CC-CALC): `declaration` is a Mathlib `Adjunction L R` between the registered
functors `left` and `right` (unit, counit, and the transpose `homEquiv`), e.g. `constLimAdj`. -/
structure AdjunctionEntry where
  id : AdjunctionId
  left : FunctorId
  right : FunctorId
  declaration : Lean.Name
  deriving Repr

/-- A cell row (CC-CALC, CC-COHERE): a natural transformation `declaration : L ⟶ R` (or, when `invertible`,
a natural isomorphism `L ≅ R`) between the composites `L`, `R` of the registered functors along
`left` and `right` (the identity of `source` when empty). The cell is Mathlib's; the row names it
so that it can be composed, whiskered and realized. An invertible cell between two distinct
structural routes identifies them (a comparison): a call reached along either runs on the route the
cell's direction designates, and its component carries data between the two. -/

  declaration : Lean.Name

/-- A property presentation row (CC-PROP): the surface name `name` of the registered classifier
`classifier`, which alone owns the property's meaning. With `receiver := some A` it is an alias
available only on `A` (e.g. `is_abelian` on groups for commutativity of the multiplicative port,
#53 §12); it adds no meaning. -/
structure PropertyEntry where
  id : PropertyId
  name : String
  classifier : ClassifierId
  receiver : Option CategoryExpr := none
  deriving Repr

/-- The kind of one argument of a typed category constructor. -/
inductive ConstructorArgKind
  | category
  | object
  | functor
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- A typed category constructor (#54 §1): its argument signature and the Lean definition that is
its semantics. A category whose expression is `.construct id args` must be definitionally
`semantics` applied to the registered denotations of `args`. -/
structure ConstructorEntry where
  id : ConstructorId
  signature : Array ConstructorArgKind
  semantics : Lean.Name
  /-- For a unary category constructor that is functorial, its action on functors
  (`F : C ⥤ D` to `semantics C ⥤ semantics D`), e.g. `Functor.mapArrow` for `Arr`. -/

/--
A parameterized category family, distinct from any selected category node.

The typed realization supplies the parameter data and its category-valued fibre.
The registry records transport orientation separately.

  /-- Whether this functor sends an object to its *underlying* object (a forgetful functor,
  an inclusion, a fibre inclusion `ι_R : Mod_R → ∫ Mod`): the only kind of registered functor
  along which methods are inherited (#53 §8, CC-UNIFORM). Not structural: construction functors
  (base change, change of values, reindexing along a parameter morphism), which need data the
  receiver does not carry, and a fibration's projection to its base or value parameters
  (`∫ Mod → Ring`, `Bil → ∫ Mod` by values), which reads a parameter of the object rather than
  an object it *is*: a module is not a ring, so it must not inherit the ring's cardinality. -/
