# The ring diamond is coherent at sets (CC-COHERE, #53 §9)

The multiplicative and the additive route from rings to sets are identified by the invertible
cell `LeanCategories.Algebra.ringCarrierComparison`, the identity natural isomorphism between their
composites; a call reached along either route runs on its source route (the multiplicative one). The comparison covers the whole route to `Sets`: the two ports stay distinct at
monoids and magmas, where they carry different operations.
