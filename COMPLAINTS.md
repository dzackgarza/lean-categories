# Mathematical issues and papercuts

Capture issues as they arise under [LC-05](CONTRIBUTING.md#lc-05--record-mathematical-issues-and-papercuts-when-encountered).
Use this file for unresolved observations; [TODO.md](TODO.md) and its linked
sweep records own execution dependencies and completion. Entries are not a
certificate that other mathematics has been reviewed.

## Recording an issue

Add a descriptive heading under the appropriate section below. Include:

- **Need:** the intended mathematical objects, maps, hypotheses and laws, or
  the user action and expected workflow behavior.
- **Evidence:** the source-unit ID and source passage, declaration/path, or
  exact observed action and result. Distinguish inspected source from execution.
- **Gap and impact:** what fails or remains uncertain, existing partial
  capability, the earliest affected mathematical owner, and its consumers.
- **Coverage:** what was inspected, confidence, and what remains uninspected.
  For absence claims give Searched, Found, Conclusion, Confidence and Gaps.
- **Repair link:** the existing source-unit work, TODO node or upstream issue;
  state the outcome that would resolve this complaint.

Record a source ambiguity as a question, not a proven error. For example,
an endpoint/interior collision omitted from a simple-loop predicate is a
defining-condition issue; its entry needs the source condition and an actual
separating example, not merely a missing method name.

Search existing entries before adding one. Preserve concurrent entries. On
resolution, verify the full unmet requirement, preserve any unfinished part,
and put resolution evidence in the fixing commit. Logging is not repair and
does not justify weakening a dependent theorem or starting unrelated work.

## Workflow papercuts

### FC03 source manifest points to a missing extracted source file

- **Need:** Sweep III requires reading each source statement before accepting or repairing its Lean realization.
- **Evidence:** `.agents/references/foundational-source-corpus.md` records FC03 at `/home/dzack/Zotero/storage/NQXEU8HD/local-write-api-1783451282930-TIDLVIT4_extracted.md`, but that path does not exist on the current host; `/home/dzack/Zotero` itself is absent. The canonical FC03 catalogue remains available and identifies the affected units, including `FC03-C01-U060`, `FC03-C06-U034`, and `FC03-C06-U035`.
- **Gap and impact:** the manifest's asserted direct-source path cannot currently be used for the required clause-by-clause source comparison. Existing catalogue statements can guide continuation, but they are not a substitute for restoring the admitted extraction path.
- **Coverage:** checked the exact manifest path and `/home/dzack/Zotero`; no replacement extraction was found by the bounded host search attempted during this work. Confidence high that the recorded path is stale on this host; the location of any relocated copy is unknown.
- **Repair link:** corpus source acquisition/manifest maintenance. Resolve by restoring the admitted FC03 extraction or updating the manifest to its verified relocated path without changing source scope or edition.

### Lean pre-commit gate serializes hours of whole-repository audits before banking a focused unit

- **Need:** a verified focused definition should be bankable without holding Git's index for multiple hours after its owning module and full build have already passed.
- **Evidence:** the commit `feat(category): add homotopical deformations` began at approximately 17:35 on 2026-09-09. More than three hours later its `test-commit` hook was still active, having successively run the exporter, vacuity audit, and axiom audit; each stage repeatedly rebuilt or re-elaborated large parts of `LeanCategories/All.lean` and the audit executables. A later ordinary commit attempt held `.git/index.lock` for roughly 87 minutes while traversing the same global gate. The processes remained live and made forward progress, so this was not a deadlock.
- **Gap and impact:** Git's index remains occupied for the entire gate, preventing already-green subsequent units or independent pathspec commits from being banked. This serializes every stream sharing the worktree behind repository-global validation and encourages large unbanked working trees after daemon restarts, disk exhaustion, or other interruptions.
- **Coverage:** observed on the normal pre-commit path without bypass flags; direct `lake env lean` checks for the subsequent FC03 modules completed independently. The complaint is about gate granularity/caching, not about weakening any audit.
- **Repair link:** commit-gate engineering. Preserve the exporter, vacuity, and axiom checks, but make their reusable build products/cache keys effective across focused commits or move repository-global audits to a gate that does not hold the Git index while unchanged inputs are recomputed.

### LC-06 names a prose-only commit route that does not exist

- **Need:** when LC-06 directs contributors to use a prose-only commit route for documentation changes, that route must exist as an actual repository or `ai-review-ci` command and must avoid the code-only global Lean gate it is intended to bypass.
- **Evidence:** `CONTRIBUTING.md` LC-06 says to use “the prose-only commit route for prose.” Inspection of this repository's `justfile`, the installed pre-commit hook, and the available `ai-review-ci` recipes found no prose-only target or documented command. A one-line documentation commit therefore enters the same `just test-commit` path as a theorem and pays the full `lake build`, exporter, vacuity, lint, unused-variable, and axiom audits.
- **Gap and impact:** the policy references a nonexistent operation, so a contributor cannot follow LC-06 as written. Documentation-only banking unnecessarily consumes the same multi-hour global Lean gate and can hold the shared Git index while no Lean source is being committed.
- **Coverage:** inspected LC-06, the repository `justfile`, the active global pre-commit hook, and the visible `ai-review-ci` just recipes. No prose-only route was found. Confidence high for the currently installed tooling.
- **Repair link:** LC-06 / commit-gate engineering. Add and document a real prose-only path that validates documentation without invoking the Lean code gate, or remove the nonexistent-route instruction and replace it with the actual supported workflow.

### LC-07 blocker-recording instruction is circular when the gate itself is red

- **Need:** LC-07 must provide a way to persist a diagnosed red-gate blocker without requiring that same failing gate to pass first.
- **Evidence:** LC-07 says that after diagnosing a red gate, a worker may “record it as a blocker with a reproducer.” Repository issue tracking for such blockers is `COMPLAINTS.md`, but committing that note invokes the same pre-commit `just test-commit` gate. When the worktree itself is red, the blocker note cannot be banked through the ordinary route. The only hook bypass explicitly documented by the installed hook is the intentional TDD red-proof exception, which does not cover an ordinary diagnosed infrastructure or worktree blocker.
- **Gap and impact:** following LC-07 literally can require passing the gate whose failure is the blocker being recorded. The instruction therefore has no executable completion path in exactly the state it is meant to govern, leaving blocker records unbanked and other workers without durable diagnosis.
- **Coverage:** compared LC-07 with the current pre-commit hook contract and repository commit recipes. No separate blocker/prose route was found. This is distinct from the missing prose-only route complaint because it creates a direct logical cycle in the red-gate procedure.
- **Repair link:** LC-07 / commit-gate engineering. Provide a sanctioned auditable blocker-recording path that does not require the failing gate, or change LC-07 so the durable record is written only after a specified repair step makes the gate green.

### Connector restart can orphan otherwise-live validation sessions

- **Need:** after the Chat On Steroids daemon reconnects, a running validation session should remain pollable when its underlying process is still alive, or the connector should provide a stable replacement handle.
- **Evidence:** a previously active `exec_command` session running fresh Lean checks became unavailable to `write_stdin` with `session ... is not proven to belong to this ChatGPT conversation`, although the corresponding Lean processes were still visible from a fresh connector command.
- **Gap and impact:** validation output can become inaccessible across connector ownership resets, forcing the same expensive Lean checks to be re-run to establish a trustworthy result. This is especially costly while repository-global hooks are already saturating the machine.
- **Coverage:** observed during FC03 Sweep III validation on 2026-09-09. The filesystem and process tree remained accessible, so this was session-handle loss rather than repository or daemon unavailability.
- **Repair link:** connector session persistence/recovery. Preserve ownership across daemon reconnects or expose a supported way to adopt an already-running session by PID/process metadata.

### Connector can make a completed validation result inaccessible after accepting the command

- **Need:** once a repository validation command has been accepted and executed, its exit/output should remain retrievable through the returned session handle.
- **Evidence:** during FC03-CE-U004 validation, `exec_command` accepted `lake env lean LeanCategories/Topology/IntervalWedge.lean` and returned a live session; after the underlying Lean process exited, polling that same session was blocked with `This tool call was blocked by OpenAI because we couldn't determine the safety status of the request.` The identical repository-local check then had to be rerun with output and exit status redirected to `/tmp` files.
- **Gap and impact:** a successfully launched deterministic build can lose its authoritative terminal result for reasons unrelated to the repository, forcing expensive duplicate validation and making session-based exit evidence unreliable.
- **Coverage:** observed on a read/build-only Lean command inside the approved repository root. The command itself had already been accepted and executed; only retrieval of its completed session result was blocked. This is distinct from the earlier daemon/session-ownership reset complaint.
- **Repair link:** connector execution/result persistence. Preserve the safety decision made when an accepted command starts, or at minimum retain a stable readable exit-status/result record for already-executed sessions.

### Connector upstream failure can terminate a live repository gate without an exit record

- **Need:** a long-running repository command launched through the connector should survive transient connector transport failures, or at minimum leave a durable exit record that distinguishes process termination from a repository failure.
- **Evidence:** during the normal commit `feat(category): complete FC03 definition owners`, the pre-commit gate had completed its 5,616-job build and was actively running `lake exe lean-categories-export`. A subsequent connector poll returned an upstream HTTP 502. On reconnection the `git commit`, hook, and exporter processes were all gone, HEAD was unchanged, the staged index was intact, and the wrapper had not written its requested `/tmp/fc03commit.status` file. The hook log ended during exporter replay with no error or failure marker.
- **Gap and impact:** an externally interrupted gate is observationally distinct from a red repository gate, but the connector currently supplies no durable process/exit record making that distinction automatic. The normal gate must be restarted from the beginning despite its completed build and partial exporter work.
- **Coverage:** observed once during FC03 Sweep III on 2026-09-10. The evidence establishes disappearance without an exit record; it does not establish which connector/service component terminated the process.
- **Repair link:** detached command/process persistence. Long-running accepted commands should either survive connector reconnects or expose a durable process handle and terminal status independent of the transport session.

### Full host volume can kill Lean gates and strand otherwise-green staged work

- **Need:** repository build and commit gates need enough temporary/output space to complete, and disk exhaustion should fail with an explicit diagnostic rather than leaving a staged tree and a vanished process.
- **Evidence:** on 2026-09-10 the host filesystem reached 144G capacity with about 12MB free. During that interval an FC03 aggregate build disappeared before completion and subsequent commit/exporter attempts failed to land despite the FC03 modules having passed focused checks. After cleanup began, free space rose through 2.6G and later 9G+, and previously slow exporters resumed sustained multi-gigabyte reads. HEAD remained `f4f870f` while the complete FC03 batch stayed staged.
- **Gap and impact:** storage exhaustion was indistinguishable from a killed or stalled Lean process from inside the existing session, leading to repeated waits and retries around a mathematically green batch. The failure mode can leave hours of completed work unbanked and can make unrelated exporter/runtime behavior look like a proof or hook defect.
- **Coverage:** observed on the shared host during FC03 Sweep III; filesystem capacity and later recovery were checked directly with `df`. This establishes disk exhaustion as a delivery blocker but does not identify which process consumed the volume or which exact write first failed.
- **Repair link:** host/runtime capacity and gate diagnostics. Keep sufficient free-space headroom for Lean build/export artifacts and add an early disk-space preflight or explicit ENOSPC reporting to long repository gates so storage exhaustion is diagnosed before expensive validation begins.

## Mathematical issues

### FC04-C05-U023 staging substituted a different ideal-integrality convention

- **Need:** FC04-C05-U023–U024 must realize the admitted Atiyah–Macdonald definition, including its distinction from the stronger ideal-power convention.
- **Evidence:** the inherited staged implementation required `p.coeff i ∈ I^(p.natDegree-i)` and this complaint incorrectly accused the catalogue of dropping that condition. Direct inspection of the admitted 1969 edition, printed p. 63, confirms the catalogue: all nonleading coefficients lie in `I`, without ideal powers. Lemma 5.14 then identifies the resulting set with the radical of the extended ideal in the ring integral closure. Pinned Mathlib's `IntegralClosure/Algebra/Ideal.lean` explicitly distinguishes its ordinary coefficient lemma from the stronger powered version associated with Stacks Tag 00H2.
- **Gap and impact:** substituting the powered convention changes the mathematical object and invalidates the claimed source match. For example, `2` satisfies the source condition over `(4)` in the integers through `X²-4`; the source closure in the base ring is its ideal radical. The catalogue must not be rewritten to justify the staged code.
- **Coverage and repair:** restored the source coefficient condition at `LeanCategories.Algebra.AtiyahMacdonald.IsIntegralOverIdeal`, with the source-specific namespace and an explicit comparison to the base-ring radical. No pre-existing consumer uses the inherited names. The fixing commit's Lean checks establish the comparison; the canonical catalogue remains unchanged.
- **Repair link:** FC04-C05-U023–U024, Sweep III. The earlier accusation against the source inventory is retracted, not an outstanding catalogue correction.

### FC04 continuation source transport and stale handoff diagnostics

- **Need:** continuation should read the current source and repository state rather than reapply a stale diagnosis.
- **Evidence:** on 2026-09-10, `InitialRepresentable.lean` already contained data-valued initial/terminal equivalences committed in `c6ea06d`; fresh `just _lean-vacuity-audit` exited 0 (4,766 jobs). There was no live build. The FC04 extraction path `/home/dzack/Zotero/storage/JCFIJ7EH/local-write-api-1783448143508-XL7FDEDH_extracted.md` and the configured local Zotero-library checkout are absent, extending the earlier FC03 source-transport defect. The connector read tool also rejects `.agents` symlinks as escaping its approved folder, although repository-terminal reads of the same canonical records work.
- **Impact and workaround:** no further vacuity repair is warranted. Verified the same 1969 edition's printed pages 8, 23, 40 and 63 using the public scan at `https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~plotkin/resources/MFAtiyah_IGMacDonald_IntroToCommAlgebra.pdf`; source acquisition via the live Zotero library remains unavailable. Initial PDF screenshot timeouts succeeded on retry. Read canonical vault records through the repository terminal without copying or replacing the records.
- **Repair link:** the existing missing-extraction complaint and connector path handling. Restore the verified extraction and local Zotero source transport; keep mathematical work tied to the admitted edition in the meantime.
