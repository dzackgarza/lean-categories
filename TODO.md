# Active mathematical work

## Where the plans live

Plans are not stored in this repository. `.agents/` is a symlink to this project's directory in
the central agent memory vault at `/home/dzack/.agent-memory-vault`, so every `.agents/...` link
below resolves in a local checkout and resolves nowhere on GitHub. `.hermes/` points at the same
directory.

The plan tree has three levels:

```
.agents/plans/
├── index.md          concept index
├── plan-dag.md       every feature, plan, phase, and task, with its dependency graph
└── features/
    └── FEATURE-<NAME>/
        ├── FEATURE-<NAME>.md          the feature: scope, ordered plans, execution records
        └── plans/
            └── PLAN-<NAME>/
                └── PLAN-<NAME>.md     one plan: status, dependencies, success criteria
```

To find plans:

- Read [plan-dag.md](.agents/plans/plan-dag.md) for the full inventory and dependency edges.
- List the features: `ls .agents/plans/features`.
- Each plan file's frontmatter carries `status`, `dependsOn`, `parents`, and `successCriteria`.
  Status is one of `unstarted`, `in-progress`, or `complete`.
- Search the vault by name or content:

  ```bash
  agent-memory search --scope project "<plan or subsystem>"
  ```

Progress belongs to two surfaces and no others: a plan's own `status`, and the whole-source
[corpus status ledger](.agents/references/foundational-corpus-status.md) for the four sweeps
below. Reference material — source catalogues, mapping records, the Lean source atlas — lives in
`.agents/references/`.

## The foundational programme

The foundational programme is source-based and corpus v1 is frozen. The exact editions,
source dependencies, prerequisite rationale, and verified Markdown extraction paths live in
[the foundational source index](.agents/references/foundational-source-corpus.md). Whole-source
progress for all four sweeps lives only in the
[central corpus status ledger](.agents/references/foundational-corpus-status.md).

The same corpus is traversed in four separate sequential sweeps:

1. catalogue every mathematical unit;
2. map every unit against existing Lean formalizations;
3. realize the complete definitional layer;
4. formalize the remaining lemmas and theorems.

Do not merge these sweeps. In particular, implementation availability must not shrink the
catalogue, and theorem formalization may be long-running without holding the definitional DSL
hostage.

## 0. Frozen foundational corpus v1

The deterministic source order is:

1. `FC01` Dummit–Foote, *Abstract Algebra*;
2. `FC02` Munkres, *Topology*;
3. `FC03` Riehl, *Category Theory in Context*;
4. `FC04` Atiyah–Macdonald, *Introduction to Commutative Algebra*;
5. `FC05` Weibel, *An Introduction to Homological Algebra*;
6. `FC06` Hartshorne, *Algebraic Geometry*;
7. `FC07` Hatcher, *Algebraic Topology*;
8. `FC08` Lee, *Introduction to Smooth Manifolds*;
9. `FC09` Neukirch, *Algebraic Number Theory*;
10. `FC10` Serre, *Local Fields*;
11. `FC11` Peters–Sterk, *Symmetric and Quadratic Forms*;
12. `FC12` Beauville, *Complex Algebraic Surfaces*.

This order was chosen by mathematical dependency and abstraction ownership, not by subject
breadth. In particular, Dummit–Foote supplies modules before Atiyah–Macdonald localizes them;
Riehl supplies categorical language before later localization/base-change/sheaf constructions
are categorically realized; Weibel supplies generic homological objects before Hartshorne and
Hatcher instantiate them; and Neukirch/Serre supply local arithmetic before Peters–Sterk's
p-adic lattice theory.

Changing corpus membership, order, edition, or bounded scope requires a new explicit corpus
version/amendment. Existing Folland/Ahlfors/Shafarevich/Whitehead/Apostol/Lam/Gerstein/etc.
catalogues remain supplementary and do not silently enlarge v1.

## 1. Sweep I — catalogue every corpus unit

Plan: [PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-CATALOGUE-SWEEP](.agents/plans/features/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS/plans/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-CATALOGUE-SWEEP/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-CATALOGUE-SWEEP.md).

Traverse `FC01` through `FC12` completely, in the frozen order. Record every formal unit:

- definitions, constructions, conventions, and notation;
- lemmas, propositions, theorems, and corollaries;
- admitted named examples/comparison statements;
- exact source location, hypotheses/data, and source-unit dependencies.

- [x] Upgrade existing definition-only catalogues into complete source-unit catalogues.
- [x] Catalogue every source without consulting Lean coverage to decide whether a row belongs.
- [x] Assign stable source-unit IDs used unchanged by all later sweeps.

Sweep I is complete for FC01–FC12: about 9,700 source units, one catalogue file per source in
`.agents/references/foundational-corpus-units-fc*.md`. Each catalogue is faithful to its frozen
Markdown extraction, which no phase has yet compared against the printed source.

A source is not fully catalogued merely because all of its definitions have existing Lean
routes; its theorem/lemma content still belongs to Sweep I.

## 2. Sweep II — map every unit onto existing Lean

Plan: [PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-MAPPING-SWEEP](.agents/plans/features/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS/plans/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-MAPPING-SWEEP/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-MAPPING-SWEEP.md).

Underway. FC01 through FC03 are mapped: all 1,234 FC01 units, all 844 FC02 units, and all 434
FC03 units carry verdicts in [the FC01 mapping record](.agents/references/foundational-corpus-mapping-fc01-dummit-foote.md),
[the FC02 mapping record](.agents/references/foundational-corpus-mapping-fc02-munkres.md), and
[the FC03 mapping record](.agents/references/foundational-corpus-mapping-fc03-riehl-category-theory-in-context.md).
FC04–FC12 are unmapped.

For **every** source-unit ID, search existing Lean work before constructing any local
formalization queue.

The mandatory search surface includes:

- pinned Mathlib source;
- current upstream Mathlib, relevant source history, and open PRs;
- Loogle, LeanSearch, Mathlib docs, and the local source atlas;
- Lean Reservoir and every discoverable packaged Lean project;
- broad GitHub code/repository search across all discoverable Lean repositories, not merely the
  curated source registry;
- local mirrored/reference corpora and statement banks such as `formal-conjectures` where
  relevant.

Search standard names, source theorem names, synonyms, namespaces, and expected type/statement
shapes. Inspect candidate declarations and hypotheses; string similarity is not a match.

Each unit must end in exactly one route class:

- `mathlib` — use the canonical Mathlib declaration/proof;
- `project-existing` — use the existing canonical LeanCategories owner;
- `package-import` — import an external Lean package;
- `reference-port` — Lean code exists but is not directly importable; preserve/copy the exact
  implementation with repo/commit/path/license provenance and port/adapt it later;
- `unmatched` — no acceptable Lean implementation was found after the exhaustive search.

- [ ] Record declaration names, repository/package, commit/tag, path, license,
  toolchain/Mathlib compatibility, and mathematical generality for every mapping.
- [ ] Import usable packages rather than reimplement them.
- [ ] Preserve non-importable Lean implementations as reference implementations rather than
  re-derive their mathematics.
- [ ] Put **only** `unmatched` units into a greenfield formalization queue.

## 3. Sweep III — realize the complete definitional layer

Plan: [PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-DEFINITION-SWEEP](.agents/plans/features/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS/plans/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-DEFINITION-SWEEP/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-DEFINITION-SWEEP.md).

Start only after Sweep II completes. Traverse every definitional source unit according to its
mapping:

- reuse `mathlib`, `project-existing`, and `package-import` owners directly;
- port/adapt `reference-port` implementations with exact provenance;
- author new Lean mathematics only for `unmatched` units.

- [ ] Realize every definition, construction, category, morphism class, functor, natural
  transformation, predicate, notation-bearing object, and universal construction.
- [ ] Define missing ambient categories and structural functors rather than introducing local
  stand-ins inside downstream subjects.
- [ ] Place every definition at the lowest mathematical owner that generates it.

Sweep III includes proofs intrinsic to making definitions well-defined: category/functor laws,
quotient well-definedness, independence of representatives, closure, and analogous structural
obligations. It does not absorb the source's general lemma/theorem programme.

Completion of Sweep III is the broad foundational-DSL milestone. Advanced definitional work may
draw on this vocabulary even while Sweep IV is incomplete; a consumer requiring an unfinished
theorem depends on that theorem specifically.

## 4. Sweep IV — formalize the remaining lemmas and theorems

Plan: [PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-THEOREM-SWEEP](.agents/plans/features/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS/plans/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-THEOREM-SWEEP/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-THEOREM-SWEEP.md).

Start after Sweep III. Traverse every non-definitional Sweep-I unit using the Sweep-II mappings:

- reuse canonical/imported proofs;
- port external reference proofs when available;
- locally prove only the `unmatched` residue.

- [ ] Formalize every remaining lemma, proposition, theorem, corollary, and admitted comparison
  with its exact hypotheses.
- [ ] Preserve the source dependency graph rather than replacing difficult results with weaker
  local substitutes.
- [ ] Link specialist theorem programmes back to their source-unit IDs.

Sweep IV may be very long-running. Unproved theorem units remain open theorem work; they are not
encoded as axioms, theorem-shaped structure fields, weakened definitions, or reasons to narrow
Sweep III.

## 5. Legacy definition catalogues

The older per-source definition catalogues in `.agents/references/definition-catalogue-*.md` are
superseded by the Sweep-I unit catalogues. They stay as cross-checks and mapping hints. They do
not define source scope, and they never enlarge corpus v1.

The four sweep plans, frozen source manifest, and central status ledger are collected under
[FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS](.agents/plans/features/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS.md).
The detailed geometry gap inventory remains `PLAN-missing-prerequisite-theory-roadmap`. GitHub
issues #22 and #30–#41 continue to own live implementation dependencies, but they do not replace
the corpus-wide four-sweep programme.
