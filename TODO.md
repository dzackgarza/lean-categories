# Active mathematical work

## Where the plans live

Plans are not stored in this repository. `.agents/` is a symlink to this project's directory in
the central agent memory vault at `/home/dzack/.agent-memory-vault`, so every `.agents/...` link
below resolves in a local checkout and resolves nowhere on GitHub. `.hermes/` points at the same
directory.

The plan tree has three levels:

```
.agents/plans/
├── index.md          concept index
├── plan-dag.md       every feature, plan, phase, and task, with its dependency graph
└── features/
    └── FEATURE-<NAME>/
        ├── FEATURE-<NAME>.md          the feature: scope, ordered plans, execution records
        └── plans/
            └── PLAN-<NAME>/
                └── PLAN-<NAME>.md     one plan: status, dependencies, success criteria
```

To find plans:

- Read [plan-dag.md](.agents/plans/plan-dag.md) for the full inventory and dependency edges.
- List the features: `ls .agents/plans/features`.
- Each plan file's frontmatter carries `status`, `dependsOn`, `parents`, and `successCriteria`.
  Status is one of `unstarted`, `in-progress`, or `complete`.
- Search the vault by name or content:

  ```bash
  agent-memory search --scope project "<plan or subsystem>"
  ```

Progress belongs to two surfaces and no others: a plan's own `status`, and the whole-source
[corpus status ledger](.agents/references/foundational-corpus-status.md) for the four sweeps
below. Reference material — source catalogues, mapping records, the Lean source atlas — lives in
`.agents/references/`.

## The foundational programme

The foundational programme is source-based and corpus v1 is frozen. The exact editions,
source dependencies, prerequisite rationale, and verified Markdown extraction paths live in
[the foundational source index](.agents/references/foundational-source-corpus.md). Whole-source
progress for all four sweeps lives only in the
[central corpus status ledger](.agents/references/foundational-corpus-status.md).

The same corpus is traversed in four separate sequential sweeps:

1. catalogue every mathematical unit;
2. map every unit against existing Lean formalizations;
3. realize the complete definitional layer;
4. formalize the remaining lemmas and theorems.

Do not merge these sweeps. In particular, implementation availability must not shrink the
catalogue, and theorem formalization may be long-running without holding the definitional DSL
hostage.

## 0. Frozen foundational corpus v1

The deterministic source order is:

1. `FC01` Dummit–Foote, *Abstract Algebra*;
2. `FC02` Munkres, *Topology*;
3. `FC03` Riehl, *Category Theory in Context*;
4. `FC04` Atiyah–Macdonald, *Introduction to Commutative Algebra*;
5. `FC05` Weibel, *An Introduction to Homological Algebra*;
6. `FC06` Hartshorne, *Algebraic Geometry*;
7. `FC07` Hatcher, *Algebraic Topology*;
8. `FC08` Lee, *Introduction to Smooth Manifolds*;
9. `FC09` Neukirch, *Algebraic Number Theory*;
10. `FC10` Serre, *Local Fields*;
11. `FC11` Peters–Sterk, *Symmetric and Quadratic Forms*;
12. `FC12` Beauville, *Complex Algebraic Surfaces*.

This order was chosen by mathematical dependency and abstraction ownership, not by subject
breadth. In particular, Dummit–Foote supplies modules before Atiyah–Macdonald localizes them;
Riehl supplies categorical language before later localization/base-change/sheaf constructions
are categorically realized; Weibel supplies generic homological objects before Hartshorne and
Hatcher instantiate them; and Neukirch/Serre supply local arithmetic before Peters–Sterk's
p-adic lattice theory.

Changing corpus membership, order, edition, or bounded scope requires a new explicit corpus
version/amendment. Amendment v2 below is the only such change so far. Existing
Folland/Ahlfors/Shafarevich/Whitehead/Apostol/Lam/Gerstein/etc. catalogues remain supplementary
and do not silently enlarge the corpus.

## 0a. Corpus v2 amendment — four admitted sources

Amendment v2 admits four sources. It does not renumber, re-edition or rescope `FC01`–`FC12`, so
every existing source-unit ID stays valid:

13. `FC13` Matsumura, *Commutative Ring Theory*;
14. `FC14` Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory*;
15. `FC15` Humphreys, *Reflection Groups and Coxeter Groups*;
16. `FC16` Humphreys, *Linear Algebraic Groups*.

Each closes a gap in the v1 dependency spine. None is admitted for subject breadth:

- `FC13` sits between `FC04` and `FC06`. Atiyah–Macdonald is deliberately slim, and Hartshorne
  assumes the homological commutative algebra it omits: regular sequences and depth,
  Cohen–Macaulay and regular local rings, Koszul complexes, completion, and flatness criteria.
  Matsumura owns that material instead of letting scheme theory reinvent it locally.
- `FC14` owns semisimple Lie algebras, root systems, weights, and their representation theory.
  No v1 source defines a root system.
- `FC15` owns reflection groups, Coxeter systems, and their geometric representations. The
  reflection and orbit applications in the research programme use these as primitives.
- `FC16` owns linear algebraic groups and their actions, so group actions on varieties and
  schemes reuse one owner rather than a local stand-in.

`FC13` is a prerequisite of `FC06`, so numeric ID order is no longer the traversal order. Corpus
v2 traverses:

`FC01`, `FC02`, `FC03`, `FC04`, `FC05`, `FC13`, `FC06`, `FC07`, `FC08`, `FC09`, `FC10`, `FC11`,
`FC12`, `FC14`, `FC15`, `FC16`.

Two further sources are admitted as **supplementary only**, not as corpus members: Folland,
*Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications*, and Conway, *A Course in Functional
Analysis*. No corpus source's dependency spine passes through measure theory or functional
analysis, so neither enters the denominator of the four sweeps. Supplementary formalization
against them stays valid.

All four v2 sources have local PDFs but no verified Markdown extraction. Each needs source
acquisition before Sweep I can traverse it.

## 1. Sweep I — catalogue every corpus unit

Plan: [PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-CATALOGUE-SWEEP](.agents/plans/features/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS/plans/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-CATALOGUE-SWEEP/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-CATALOGUE-SWEEP.md).

Traverse every corpus source completely, in the v2 traversal order above. Record every formal
unit:

- definitions, constructions, conventions, and notation;
- lemmas, propositions, theorems, and corollaries;
- admitted named examples/comparison statements;
- exact source location, hypotheses/data, and source-unit dependencies.

- [x] Upgrade existing definition-only catalogues into complete source-unit catalogues.
- [x] Catalogue every source without consulting Lean coverage to decide whether a row belongs.
- [x] Assign stable source-unit IDs used unchanged by all later sweeps.

Which sources are catalogued is stated only in
[the corpus status ledger](.agents/references/foundational-corpus-status.md). The catalogues
themselves are one file per source in
`.agents/references/foundational-corpus-units-fc*.md`. Each catalogue is faithful to its frozen
Markdown extraction, which no phase has yet compared against the printed source.

A source is not fully catalogued merely because all of its definitions have existing Lean
routes; its theorem/lemma content still belongs to Sweep I.

## 2. Sweep II — map every unit onto existing Lean

Plan: [PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-MAPPING-SWEEP](.agents/plans/features/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS/plans/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-MAPPING-SWEEP/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-MAPPING-SWEEP.md).

Underway. Which sources are mapped is stated only in
[the corpus status ledger](.agents/references/foundational-corpus-status.md); the per-source
verdicts live in the mapping records beside it, one file per source,
`.agents/references/foundational-corpus-mapping-fc*.md`.

Take a source, not a chapter. Choose the first source in the v2 traversal order whose Mapping box
is unticked and that no other agent has named as in progress, name it at the head of its mapping
record, then map it straight through to the end and tick its box yourself. Do not stop between
chapters to be told to continue, and do not wait to be given a source.

For **every** source-unit ID, search existing Lean work before constructing any local
formalization queue.

The mandatory search surface includes:

- pinned Mathlib source;
- current upstream Mathlib, relevant source history, and open PRs;
- Loogle, LeanSearch, Mathlib docs, and the local source atlas;
- Lean Reservoir and every discoverable packaged Lean project;
- broad GitHub code/repository search across all discoverable Lean repositories, not merely the
  curated source registry;
- local mirrored/reference corpora and statement banks such as `formal-conjectures` where
  relevant.

Search standard names, source theorem names, synonyms, namespaces, and expected type/statement
shapes. Inspect candidate declarations and hypotheses; string similarity is not a match.

Each unit must end in exactly one route class:

- `mathlib` — use the canonical Mathlib declaration/proof;
- `project-existing` — use the existing canonical LeanCategories owner;
- `package-import` — import an external Lean package;
- `reference-port` — Lean code exists but is not directly importable; preserve/copy the exact
  implementation with repo/commit/path/license provenance and port/adapt it later;
- `unmatched` — no acceptable Lean implementation was found after the exhaustive search.

- [ ] Record declaration names, repository/package, commit/tag, path, license,
  toolchain/Mathlib compatibility, and mathematical generality for every mapping.
- [ ] Import usable packages rather than reimplement them.
- [ ] Preserve non-importable Lean implementations as reference implementations rather than
  re-derive their mathematics.
- [ ] Put **only** `unmatched` units into a greenfield formalization queue.

## 3. Sweep III — realize the complete definitional layer

Plan: [PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-DEFINITION-SWEEP](.agents/plans/features/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS/plans/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-DEFINITION-SWEEP/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-DEFINITION-SWEEP.md).

Start only after Sweep II completes. Traverse every definitional source unit according to its
mapping:

- reuse `mathlib`, `project-existing`, and `package-import` owners directly;
- port/adapt `reference-port` implementations with exact provenance;
- author new Lean mathematics only for `unmatched` units.

- [ ] Realize every definition, construction, category, morphism class, functor, natural
  transformation, predicate, notation-bearing object, and universal construction.
- [ ] Define missing ambient categories and structural functors rather than introducing local
  stand-ins inside downstream subjects.
- [ ] Place every definition at the lowest mathematical owner that generates it.

Sweep III includes proofs intrinsic to making definitions well-defined: category/functor laws,
quotient well-definedness, independence of representatives, closure, and analogous structural
obligations. It does not absorb the source's general lemma/theorem programme.

Completion of Sweep III is the broad foundational-DSL milestone. Advanced definitional work may
draw on this vocabulary even while Sweep IV is incomplete; a consumer requiring an unfinished
theorem depends on that theorem specifically.

## 4. Sweep IV — formalize the remaining lemmas and theorems

Plan: [PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-THEOREM-SWEEP](.agents/plans/features/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS/plans/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-THEOREM-SWEEP/PLAN-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS-THEOREM-SWEEP.md).

Start after Sweep III. Traverse every non-definitional Sweep-I unit using the Sweep-II mappings:

- reuse canonical/imported proofs;
- port external reference proofs when available;
- locally prove only the `unmatched` residue.

- [ ] Formalize every remaining lemma, proposition, theorem, corollary, and admitted comparison
  with its exact hypotheses.
- [ ] Preserve the source dependency graph rather than replacing difficult results with weaker
  local substitutes.
- [ ] Link specialist theorem programmes back to their source-unit IDs.

Sweep IV may be very long-running. Unproved theorem units remain open theorem work; they are not
encoded as axioms, theorem-shaped structure fields, weakened definitions, or reasons to narrow
Sweep III.

## 5. Legacy definition catalogues

The older per-source definition catalogues in `.agents/references/definition-catalogue-*.md` are
superseded by the Sweep-I unit catalogues. They stay as cross-checks and mapping hints. They do
not define source scope, and they never enlarge corpus v1.

The four sweep plans, frozen source manifest, and central status ledger are collected under
[FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS](.agents/plans/features/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS/FEATURE-FOUNDATIONAL-CORPUS.md).
The detailed geometry gap inventory remains `PLAN-missing-prerequisite-theory-roadmap`. GitHub
issues #22 and #30–#41 continue to own live implementation dependencies, but they do not replace
the corpus-wide four-sweep programme.
